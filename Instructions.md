# Welcome to your second lab!

## Task
In this lab, you will create a list of your top 5 favorites. What you choose to do is up to you! Here are some examples:

## Top 5 list examples(not limited)
1. Food
2. Dessert
3. Sports teams
4. Games
5. Clothing brands
6. Animals
7. TV shows
8. Recipes

## Steps

1. Once you choose your topic, write the title in the index using a HEADING tag.

2. Using paragraph tags, write 2-3 sentences explaining why you choose to do this top list. If you like Food, you may say "I am making this list because I love food. I want to share my top 5 list with my classmates!"

3. Come up with your list of items(min 5), but you can always add more. Decide whether the items will be an ordered (numbered) list or an unordered (bullet point) list. Add these items to your code.

4. Add one link to a website on more information about this topic. The link should say "Click here for more!"

5. (optional/Open Honors) Turn each item in the list from step 3 into a link! For example, if you like spaghetti and meatballs, you can turn that list item into a link for a recipe for that food item.
